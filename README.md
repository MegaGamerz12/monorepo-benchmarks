## Introduction

Monorepos are becoming increasingly popular in the development community. They allow teams to manage multiple projects in a single repository. This setup can simplify dependency management and improve collaboration. However, choosing the right tool for your monorepo can be challenging. This repository benchmarks various tools to help you make an informed decision.

## Supported Tools

In this repository, we focus on the following tools:

- **Bazel**: A build tool that supports large-scale software development.
- **Gradle**: A powerful build automation tool that supports multiple languages.
- **Lage**: A fast task runner for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos.
- **Lerna**: A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.
- **Nx**: A set of extensible dev tools for monorepos.
- **Pants**: A build system that focuses on speed and scalability.
- **Rush**: A scalable monorepo manager for JavaScript.
- **Turborepo**: A high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the benchmarks, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MegaGamerz12/monorepo-benchmarks.git
   cd monorepo-benchmarks
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Each tool has its own set of dependencies. Refer to the documentation for each tool to install them.

3. **Run Benchmarks**: 
   Follow the instructions in the `README.md` of each tool to run the benchmarks. 

4. **View Results**: 
   After running the benchmarks, check the results in the `results` directory.

## Benchmarking Process

Our benchmarking process involves several key steps:

1. **Setup**: Each tool is set up according to its best practices. We ensure that the configurations are optimal for performance.

2. **Execution**: We run a series of tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. This includes building projects, running tests, and deploying applications.

3. **Data Collection**: We collect data on build times, resource usage, and any errors encountered during the process.

4. **Analysis**: The collected data is analyzed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each tool.

5. **Reporting**: Results are compiled into a report that summarizes the findings.

## Results

The results of our benchmarks will be published regularly. You can find the latest results in the `results` directory.
